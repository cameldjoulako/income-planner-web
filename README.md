# Income Planner – Personal Financial Projection

This project is a frontend application built with **Angular**.

It is based on a simple and common observation, especially relevant in African and emerging markets:

> Many people save money regularly without having a clear, numerical view of how their capital evolves over time.

The goal is not to provide financial advice, but to **make financial projections understandable, visual, and transparent**.

---

## Project goals

The application allows users to:

- display yearly financial projections f
- visualize capital growth over time
- lay the foundation for a more advanced tool (scenario comparison, backend, authentication)
